# A simple 2D game template based on classical mechanics

This is just a little experiment to toy with F# and game development.
It uses the [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) library as the basic framework (game loop, graphics and input).

The main inspiration has been an [F# Game Tutorial by YJ Park](http://blog.yjpark.org/blog/2019/01/02/fsharp-game-tutorial-overview/).

The basic template is from the [MonoGame Getting Started tutorial](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/0_getting_started.html), which I have ported to F# (as better as I could, being new at it) and extended.

At present I have added basic physics such as acceleration and inhertia, gravity, elastic collision with viewport borders and drag (a.k.a. air/fluid resistance).

This is not quality code, please feel free to submit constructive criticism!
